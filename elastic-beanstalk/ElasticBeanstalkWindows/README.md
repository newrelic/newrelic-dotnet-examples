# AWS Elastic Beanstalk on Windows / IIS

The sample demonstrates how to configure a .NET web app for deployment to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) (Windows x64 / IIS), including the New Relic Infrastructure Agent and the New Relic .NET Agent.

The application is just a basic ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app, as generated by Visual Studio. No changes have been made in the code.

The `.ebextensions\01-new-relic-install.config` file contains everything needed to install both agents and configure the needed environment variables for each. You will configure your application name and license key in that file. (Note that the `option_settings` section of the config file could be replaced by manually specifying the environment variables in the AWS environment configuration console for your Elastic Beanstalk deployment.)

Deploy the application using the latest version of the [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/). You can also use the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) to deploy the application.
