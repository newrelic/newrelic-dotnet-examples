# AWS Elastic Beanstalk on Linux

This sample demonstrates how to install and configure the New Relic .NET agent for deployment to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) (.NET 8 / x64 / Amazon Linux 2023).

The application is just a basic ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app, as generated by Visual Studio. No changes have been made in the code.

The `.ebextensions\newrelic-dotnet-agent-install.config` file contains everything needed to install the agent and configure the needed environment variables. Create a `.ebextensions` folder at the root of your application and copy `newrelic-dotnet-agent-install.config` to it, then configure your license key and application name. Also be sure that the `.ebextensions` folder and contents are set to be included when you publish your application. (Note that the `option_settings` section of the config file could be replaced by manually specifying the environment variables in the AWS environment configuration console for your Elastic Beanstalk deployment.)

Deploy the application using the latest version of the [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/). You can also use the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) to deploy the application.
