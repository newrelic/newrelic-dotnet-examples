# New Relic .NET Agent Sample - Custom XML Instrumentation

## Overview
This sample demonstrates the use of a custom instrumentation XML in a .NET 9 Console app, using the `NewRelic.Agent` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NewRelic.Agent). The application runs a `BackgroundService` that requests the current weather for Portland, OR (using a free api service) every 5 seconds and writes the JSON response to the console.

Custom instrumentation via XML is appropriate in cases where you cannot modify the source code of the application, or where you want to apply the same instrumentation to multiple applications. The XML file is used to define the custom instrumentation rules, which are then applied by the New Relic .NET agent at runtime.

The `custom-instrumentation.xml` file defines the custom instrumentation for the application. It specifies that `BackgroundService.GetTheWeatherAsync()` should be instrumented as a non-web transaction. An explicit metric name of `GetTheWeather` is specified, so the transaction will appear in the New Relic UI as `OtherTransaction/Custom/GetTheWeather`.

In order for custom instrumentation to be picked up by the .NET agent, the `custom-instrumentation.xml` file must be placed in the `extensions` folder below the New Relic .NET agent installation folder. For this specific application, the .NET agent is deployed from a NuGet package, so the installation folder will be the `newrelic` folder in the application's output directory. `runSample.ps1` copies the `custom-instrumentation.xml` file to the appropriate location before starting the application.

For other installation types, you may need to manually copy the `custom-instrumentation.xml` file to the appropriate location. For example, if you are using the .NET agent MSI installer, the `extensions` folder will be located in the `ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent\Extensions` folder. Refer to [Create Transactions using XML](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/create-transactions-xml-net/#creating-custom-txn) for more information.

## To run this sample:
1. Edit `runSample.ps1` and replace `<your-new-relic-license-key>` with your New Relic license key.
2. Start a Powershell terminal window and navigate to the `custom-instrumentation\xml-custom-instrumentation` folder, then run:
    ```
    .\runSample.ps1
    ```
3. Log in to your New Relic account and look for the `CustomInstrumentationXmlSample` app on the APM Summary page (it can take a few minutes). The custom instrumentation transactions will be under `Transaction type = Non-web`.
4. You can view the logs generated by the New Relic .NET Agent by navigating to the `bin\release\net9.0\newrelic\logs` folder.
